# Car-Prices-
This project is  model that predicts the price of a car based on its features. The main branch uses deep learning approach while the other branch explored other approaches. 
5 different ML models were used: Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Decision Trees and Random Forest. It was observed that the random forest model performed way better thn than other models. Thus, it was adopted. Hyperparameter tuning was done to improve the model's performance. 
Afterwards, a function was created to take in car features and consume the model for the Car Price prediction.
